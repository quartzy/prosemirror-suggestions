# prosemirror-suggestions

A plugin for [ProseMirror](https://prosemirror.net/) that helps you add suggestions to your editor.

This package is based on [@quartzy/prosemirror-suggestions](https://github.com/quartzy/prosemirror-suggestions) by Tristan Pemble.

"Suggestions" is a loose concept; while we originally designed this plugin around `@mentions` or `#hash-tags`, we hope
that it can be adapted to other use cases.

This plugin will not render any UI for you. The goal is to handle triggers, giving you tools to render your own UI
elements however you choose.
